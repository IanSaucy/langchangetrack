# Langchangetrack 

***Langchangetrack*** is an implementation of the methods described in the paper as python package. 
The package is available [here](https://github.com/viveksck/langchangetrack) with sample usage instructions. The details are also available in our paper: [http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3315](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3315). 

## Summary of usage

The package contains implementations of the below general ***meta-algorithm***:

1.  **Time series construction**: We model evolution of a word through time by constructing time series. 
2.  **Change point detection**: We then analyze this time series to detect ***changepoints*** which are statistically significant. 

***Input***
The input is assumed to be a temporal corpus of text files (appropriately tokenized) to be present in a directory. In addition we assume list of words in a single text file that one is interested in tracking. This could just be the set of words in the common vocabulary of the temporal corpus.

***Output***
The output consists of the significance scores for each word indicating when a change point was detected and its significance.

Sample commands and examples with detailed usage options are described at the package site.
